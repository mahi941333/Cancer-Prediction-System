# Cancer-Prediction-System
This uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict the probability where the  user is having the chances of cancer or not on the basis of the symptoms filled by the user.This system compares the various algorithms of machine learning like tree, Random forests, linear etc to predict the chances of having cancer approximate to an accurate conclusion on most of the test cases .This is made on Jupyter notebook using python3.
